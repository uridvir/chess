FIXED #1: A pinned piece cannot capture the piece pinning it.
FIXED #2: En passant does not work.
FIXED #3: Castling does not work.
#4: No checkmate detection (the checkmated player can't make any moves, but no message appears declaring checkmate).
FIXED #5: The king can escape check if it moves opposite the attacking piece (so that the attacking piece's path to the
new position is blocked by the king's old position)
#6: En passant can be performed after a delay (en passant should only be possible directly after the victim pawn moves).
